# Cocobot-Voice
 Voice recognition system developed for the Cocobot robot. This hybrid system performs active voice detection and local custom keyword detection, combined with OpenAI services. This development is part of my final degree project, which I completed at the Pontifical University of Salamanca.
The ReSpeaker Mic Array V2 audio capture device was used to build this system, which integrates a voice detection system and other functionalities.
The development is written in Python and uses Picovoice's Porcupine keyword recognition engine along with OpenAI services to operate.


This project is solely for educational and research purposes. For any commercial use, it's a good idea to review the licenses for the technologies used or replace them with open-source ones.
